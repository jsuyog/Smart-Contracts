# DutchAuction

A Dutch auction is one of several similar types of auctions for buying or selling goods. Most commonly, it means an auction in which the auctioneer begins with a high
asking price in the case of selling, and lowers it until some participant accepts the price, or it reaches a predetermined reserve price.

I implemented same functionality in the contract here seller will deploy the contract at that time he will give details about the item and the escrowAgent, startingSellingprice of the item.
Buyers can bid on the item according to that the current value will be changed of the item.
Auction will end once the time is complete which I have given as 5 minutes and it cal be also stopped by the seller.
THe buy can pay the money to escrow and escrow will send the mony to sellerr for the Item.
